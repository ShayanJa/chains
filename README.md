# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

# Addition of Chain helper

Add other chains easily to your hardhat config

```shell
node chain.js add scroll
node chain.js add rinkeby
node chain.js list
node chain.js find arbitrum

```
